# Introduction

**KoreShield** is an enterprise-grade security middleware designed to protect GenAI applications from prompt injection, data exfiltration, and operational abuse. It functions as an intelligent firewall between your application and LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek).

<Callout type="info">
  **Core Value**: KoreShield ensures that your LLM applications remain secure, compliant, and reliable by sanitizing inputs and validating outputs in real-time.
</Callout>

## The Security Challenge

Integrating LLMs into production environments introduces novel attack vectors that traditional WAFs cannot detect:

1.  **Prompt Injection**: Malicious actors manipulating the model's instructions to bypass safety guardrails.
2.  **Indirect Injection (RAG)**: Compromised external data (emails, documents) hijacking the model's context.
3.  **Data Leakage**: Unintentional exposure of PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or proprietary secrets.
4.  **Denial of Service**: Resource exhaustion attacks targeting expensive LLM tokens.

## How KoreShield Works

KoreShield operates as a **transparent proxy**. It intercepts API requests, performs deep security analysis, and enforces your organization's security policies before the request reaches the model provider.
