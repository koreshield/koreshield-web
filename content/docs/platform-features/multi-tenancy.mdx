description: Architecting KoreShield for multi-tenant SaaS applications with strict isolation.

# Multi-Tenancy

KoreShield is built from the ground up for SaaS platforms and enterprise environments where data isolation is paramount.

## Architecture

*   **Tenant ID**: Every request is tagged with a `X-Tenant-ID` header.
*   **Data Isolation**: Logs, metrics, and configurations are logically separated by Tenant ID.
*   **Rate Limiting**: Define unique rate limits per tenant to prevent "noisy neighbor" issues.

*Documentation in progress. This guide will cover provisioning tenants, setting quotas, and audit logging.*
