# Custom Rules DSL

Sometimes standard detection isn't enough. The Custom Rules DSL allows you to define highly specific patterns to block.

## Syntax

Rules are defined in YAML or JSON.

```yaml
- name: "Block Competitor Mentions"
  type: "regex"
  pattern: "(Anthropic|OpenAI|Google)"
  action: "block"
  severity: "low"
```

*Documentation in progress. Full reference for regex, semantic matching, and conditional logic coming soon.*
