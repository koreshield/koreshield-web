# Monitoring & Alerting

Observability is key to maintaining a secure AI infrastructure. KoreShield exposes comprehensive metrics and integrates with standard observability tools.

## Metrics

We export metrics in Prometheus format at `/metrics`. 

*   `koreshield_requests_total`: Total number of requests.
*   `koreshield_attacks_blocked`: Number of blocked attacks.
*   `koreshield_latency_seconds`: Request processing latency.

*Documentation in progress. Coming soon: Grafana dashboard templates and webhook alert configuration.*
