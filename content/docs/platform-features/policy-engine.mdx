# Policy Engine

The Policy Engine determines *what to do* when a threat is detected or a rule is triggered. It acts as the decision maker, sitting between the Detection Engine and the downstream LLM provider.

## Core Concepts

*   **Policies**: Sets of rules that define allowed and blocked behaviors.
*   **Actions**: The outcome when a policy is triggered (Block, Warn, Log, Redact).
*   **Scopes**: Policies can be applied globally, per-tenant, or per-user.

*Documentation in progress. Check back soon for the full guide on defining RBAC roles and JSON-based policy definitions.*
