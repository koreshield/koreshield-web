# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is the performance overhead?
KoreShield adds approximately **5-20ms** of latency per request, depending on the complexity of the detection rules enabled.

### Can I run this in production?
Yes. We recommend running behind a standard reverse proxy (Nginx) and ensuring you have configured Rate Limiting and proper Authentication.

### Does it support streaming responses?
Yes. The proxy supports full streaming (Server-Sent Events) for OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

### How do I add a custom detection rule?
Currently, custom rules can be added via the `config.yaml` blocklist or by extending the `AttackDetector` class in Python. We are working on a DSL for custom rules in the Dashboard.

### Is my data saved?
By default, KoreShield logs metadata and events to `logs/koreshield.log`. It does NOT store the full body of safe prompts unless configured to do so for debugging.
