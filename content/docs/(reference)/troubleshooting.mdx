# Troubleshooting Guide

Common issues and solutions for KoreShield.

## 1. "Provider Error: 401 Unauthorized"

**Symptoms**: Requests fail with 500 error, logs show "Provider API error".
**Cause**: Missing or incorrect API keys for the downstream LLM provider.
**Fix**:
- Check `.env` file for `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.
- Verify keys are valid.
- Restart the server to reload environment variables.

## 2. "Connection Refused" (CLI/Client)

**Symptoms**: Client cannot connect to `http://localhost:8000`.
**Cause**: The KoreShield proxy is not running or running on a different port.
**Fix**:
- Run `uvicorn src.koreshield.main:app --reload --port 8000`
- Check if port 8000 is occupied (`lsof -i :8000`).

## 3. "Blocked by KoreShield" (False Positives)

**Symptoms**: Legitimate prompts are being blocked.
**Cause**: Sensitivity settings are too high or a specific rule is too aggressive.
**Fix**:
- Go to Dashboard > Configuration.
- Lower "Sensitivity" to "Low".
- Or, whitelist specific terms in the "Allowlist".

## 4. Dashboard Login Issues

**Symptoms**: Cannot log in to the admin dashboard.
**Cause**: GitHub OAuth not configured or database connection for auth failed.
**Fix**:
- Check `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- Ensure `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` is set.
