KoreShield is an open-source security platform designed to protect enterprise applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs) from prompt injection attacks. It acts as a transparent security layer between your application and LLM API providers (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), sanitizing inputs, detecting threats, and enforcing policies before requests reach the model.

## Why KoreShield?

Prompt injection attacks pose a critical security risk for LLM-integrated systems. Attackers can:
- Override system instructions
- Extract sensitive data
- Bypass security controls
- Manipulate AI behavior
- Exfiltrate proprietary information

KoreShield provides defense-in-depth protection with four core security components:

- **Input Sanitization**: Cleans and normalizes prompts to remove potentially malicious content
- **Attack Detection**: Analyzes prompts and responses for signs of prompt injection and other attacks
- **Policy Enforcement**: Applies configurable security rules and determines how to handle suspicious requests
- **Audit Logging**: Records all security events and decisions for compliance and monitoring

## Supported LLM Providers

KoreShield supports multiple LLM providers through its proxy architecture:

- **DeepSeek** - High-performance models with OpenAI-compatible API
- **OpenAI** - GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and other models
- **Anthropic** - Claude models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, etc.)
- **Google Gemini** - Coming soon
- **Azure OpenAI** - Coming soon

## Getting Started

### Quick Install

**Python SDK:**
```bash
pip install koreshield
```

**JavaScript/TypeScript SDK:**
```bash
npm install koreshield
```

### Deployment Options

KoreShield offers flexible deployment options:

### 1. Proxy Mode (Recommended)
Deploy KoreShield as a standalone security proxy service. Your application sends LLM requests to KoreShield, which validates them before forwarding to your provider. This offers the best security isolation and works with any programming language.

```bash
# Docker deployment
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-key \
  koreshield/koreshield

# Railway deployment
railway up
```

### 2. SDK Mode
Use the `koreshield` Python or JavaScript SDK to communicate with your KoreShield proxy or integrate security features directly into your application.

```python
from koreshield import KoreShieldClient

client = KoreShieldClient(base_url="http://localhost:8000")
result = client.scan_prompt("Hello, how are you?")
```

## Architecture (Proxy Mode)

When running in Proxy Mode, KoreShield sits transparently between your application and LLM providers:

                                                                    │  Audit Logger   │
                                                                    └─────────────────┘
```
