# Configuration

KoreShield is highly configurable via `config/config.yaml` or through environment variables.

## Basic Configuration

The configuration file is YAML-based. Key sections include server settings, security policies, and provider configurations.

```yaml
server:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8000

logging:
  level: INFO
  json_logs: false

security:
  sensitivity: medium
  default_action: block
  features:
    sanitization: true
    detection: true
    policy_enforcement: true

providers:
  openai:
    enabled: true
    base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"

alerting:
  enabled: false
```

## Security Settings

### Sensitivity Levels

- **Low**: Only blocks high-confidence attacks.
- **Medium** (Default): Balanced protection.
- **High**: Aggressive blocking, zero-trust approach.

### Default Action

- **Block**: Rejects the request with a 403 error.
- **Warn**: Logs the attack but allows the request to proceed (monitoring mode).

## Environment Variables

Sensitive credentials should be set as environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | API Key for OpenAI provider |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | API Key for Anthropic provider |
| `KORESHIELD_SECRET` | Secret for JWT signing |

## Dynamic Configuration

You can also update security settings at runtime using the Management API:

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8000/v1/management/config/security \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sensitivity": "high"}'
```
