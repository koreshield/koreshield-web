# Installation

KoreShield can be used in two ways: as a **standalone proxy** (recommended for production) or as an **SDK** integrated directly into your application code.

## 1. Proxy Installation (Docker)

The standalone proxy sits between your application and LLM providers. This is the **most secure** deployment method as it operates independently of your application logic.

```bash
docker pull koreshield/koreshield
docker run -p 8000:8000 koreshield/koreshield
```

## 2. SDK Installation

The SDKs allow you to integrate KoreShield features (sanitization, scanning) directly into your codebase or interact with a deployed KoreShield Proxy.

### Python SDK

```bash
pip install koreshield
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript SDK

```bash
npm install koreshield
```

## Verification

To verify that the **Python SDK** has been installed successfully:

```bash
python -c "import koreshield; print(koreshield.__version__)"
```

## System Requirements (Proxy)

- **Docker**: Engine 20.10+
- **Memory**: 512MB recommended
- **Network**: Outbound HTTPS access to LLM providers

## Next Steps

- **[Configuration](/docs/configuration)**: Configure security policies.
