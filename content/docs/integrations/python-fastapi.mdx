# FastAPI Integration Guide

KoreShield integrates seamlessly with **FastAPI** applications, allowing you to protect your endpoints with minimal code changes.

## Overview

There are two primary ways to integrate KoreShield with FastAPI:

1.  **Middleware approach**: Protects all or specific routes automatically.
2.  **Dependency injection**: Allows fine-grained control inside route handlers.

## Option 1: Dependency Injection (Recommended)

Using dependency injection gives you access to the KoreShield client within your route, allowing you to handle blocked requests gracefully or return custom error responses.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from koreshield.client import KoreShieldClient
import os

app = FastAPI()

def get_koreshield():
    # Configure with your KoreShield Proxy URL
    return KoreShieldClient(base_url=os.getenv("KORESHIELD_URL", "http://localhost:8000"))

@app.post("/chat")
async def chat(message: str, ks: KoreShieldClient = Depends(get_koreshield)):
    # 1. Guard the input
    result = await ks.guard(message)
    
    if not result.is_safe:
        # 2. Handle unsafe content
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=403,
            detail={
                "error": "Content blocked",
                "reason": result.reason,
                "details": result.details
            }
        )
        
    # 3. Process safe content
    return {"response": "Processed successfully"}
```

## Option 2: Middleware

(Coming soon) We are working on a standard ASGI middleware package for drop-in protection.

## Configuration

Ensure your KoreShield Proxy is running and accessible. By default, the client connects to `http://localhost:8000`. You can configure this via environment variables or constructor arguments.

| Environment Variable | Description | Default |
|----------------------|-------------|---------|
| `KORESHIELD_URL` | URL of the KoreShield Proxy | `http://localhost:8000` |
| `KORESHIELD_API_KEY` | API Key (if auth enabled) | None |
