# Compliance & Certifications

KoreShield is designed to help organizations meet strict security and privacy standards. This guide outlines how our architecture supports compliance with major frameworks.

## SOC 2 Type II

KoreShield creates an audit trail that is essential for SOC 2 controls.

### Security Controls
- **Access Control**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures only authorized users can modify security policies.
- **Monitoring**: Real-time logging of all security events and policy violations.
- **Change Management**: Versioned policy configurations allow for safe rollbacks and change tracking.

## HIPAA Compliance

For healthcare organizations handling Protected Health Information (PHI).

### PHI Protection
- **Redaction**: Automatically detect and redact PHI (names, SSNs, medical record numbers) before data leaves your boundary.
- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- **BAA**: Enterprise plans include a Business Associate Agreement (BAA).

```typescript
// Example: Configuring PHI Redaction
const koreshield = new KoreShield({
  apiKey: process.env.KEY,
  policy: {
    pii: {
      action: 'redact',
      types: ['us_ssn', 'medical_record_number', 'patient_name']
    }
  }
});
```

## GDPR Considerations

### Data Sovereignty
- **Region Locking**: Configure KoreShield to process data only within specific EU regions.
- **Right to Erasure**: API endpoints to delete all data associated with a specific user ID.
- **Data Minimization**: We strictly limit data retention periods based on your configuration.

## PCI-DSS Requirements

For handling payment card information.

- **PCI Masking**: Automatically mask credit card numbers in logs and prompts.
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable logs of all access to cardholder data flows.

## FedRAMP (Government)

KoreShield's GovCloud deployment option ensures:
- **FIPS 140-2 Validated Encryption**
- **US Persons Only Support**
- **GovCloud Hosting**
