# ⚠️  SECURITY WARNING: Never commit this file with real secrets!
# ⚠️  All VITE_* variables are embedded in the frontend bundle and visible to users
# ⚠️  Only put PUBLIC, non-sensitive values here
# =============================================================================

# API Configuration
# The backend API base URL (publicly visible)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.koreshield.com

# ⚠️  DEPRECATED: Do not use API keys in frontend
# VITE_API_KEY has been removed for security reasons
# All authenticated requests now use JWT tokens from the auth service
# If you need an API key for backend-to-backend communication, 
# store it in the backend .env file, NOT here.

# ⚠️  DEPRECATED: Simulated API mode (for demos only)
# Use real backend in production
VITE_USE_SIMULATED_API=false

# Authentication
# Note: Clerk keys are publishable (public) keys and safe to expose
# These only allow authentication, not admin operations
# VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_clerk_publishable_key_here

# Analytics (Optional)
# These are public tracking IDs and safe to expose
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
VITE_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN=koreshield.com

# Environment
VITE_ENV=production

# =============================================================================
# Security Best Practices:
# =============================================================================
# 1. Never store secret keys (API keys, passwords, private keys) in this file
# 2. Only use VITE_PUBLIC_* prefix for truly public configuration
# 3. Sensitive operations must be handled by backend with proper authentication
# 4. JWT tokens are stored in localStorage with short expiration times
# 5. All admin API endpoints require valid JWT token verification
# 6. Backend implements rate limiting and CORS restrictions
